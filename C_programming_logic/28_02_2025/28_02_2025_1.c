GradingSystem
Write a C program that takes a student's marks (0 to 100) as input and displays the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

Grading System:
90 - 100 ‚Üí Grade A
80 - 89 ‚Üí Grade B
70 - 79 ‚Üí Grade C
60 - 69 ‚Üí Grade D
50 - 59 ‚Üí Grade E
Below 50 ‚Üí Fail

Use an else if ladder to determine the grade.
Ensure the program properly handles invalid input (e.g., negative marks or marks above 100).
Sample Input
85
Sample Output
Grade: B

Program Questions
Strictly Increasing Order
Write a C program that takes  3 integer N1, N2, N3 and checks if its digits are in strictly increasing order (left to right) or Decreasing Order.
For example : 
N1 = 1, N2 = 2, N3 = 4
N1<N2<N3 [Strictly Increasing]

If the digits increase strictly, print "Strictly Increasing".
If the digits are equal anywhere, print "Not Strictly Increasing".
If the digits decrease at any point, print "Decreasing Order".

Use only else-if ladder.
Sample Input
